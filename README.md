Scraping Google Maps for all relative company data to desired search
During my internship with KVLR Capital, I was tasked to create a code that would scrape google maps for all data pertaining to physician groups.
Give the code search directions and it will open up google Chrome, go to maps.google.com and search for your desired input.
After searching, it will click in and out of each company and gather all data pertaining to that company.
It will click onto the next 20 entries after the first 20 companies information and data is gathered and stored into an excel file.
It will go through the gathering of information process again and continue going to the next pages until all companies information is stored.
Once completed, it will exit google. From there you can open your excel file and all the data should be neatly stored.
